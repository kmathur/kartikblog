I’ll write about things that interest me in general, along with technical topics around AI and large-scale infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m naturally more reflective and reserved, and sometimes it’s hard for me to fully express my ideas out loud. Writing and journaling has always been how I think clearly and make sense of things. I’ve been doing this informally for quite some time, mostly for myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2026, I finally decided to publish and share some of my recent writing. This is very much an experiment, a place to think out loud, explore ideas, and see where they lead. Ideally, I’d love for this to grow into a small community where I can share ideas, learn from others, and have thoughtful conversations along the way.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="General"/><category term="welcome"/><category term="introduction"/></entry></feed>
