## About me

Hey there! I'm Kartik Mathur, and welcome to my little corner of the internet.

Currently, I'm the Director of Engineering at [Snorkel AI](https://snorkel.ai), where I lead the teams responsible for building and scaling the AI infrastructure behind the Snorkel labeling platform. Previously, I served as an Engineering Manager at Domino Data Lab, driving initiatives in machine learning and data infrastructure.

I'm passionate about open-source software and have been an active contributor to the cloud-native ecosystem. During my time at Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), I served as a Master Technologist, leading MLOps initiatives on the HPE Ezmeral Software Platform and contributing extensively to the [KubeDirector project](https://github.com/bluek8s/kubedirector). My work has been recognized by the broader community, including an invited talk at the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) on Building Dynamic Machine Learning Pipelines with KubeDirector.

## My Journey

My path in tech started at AMD, followed by engineering leadership roles at several technology startups, including BlueData (acquired by HPE in 2019). I hold multiple granted patents in distributed systems, machine learning platforms, and data infrastructure, which you can find [here](https://patents.google.com/?inventor=Kartik+Mathur).

Academically, I earned my MS in Computer Science from Indiana University Bloomington, where my research focused on parallel computing and distributed systems. These days, I'm deeply interested in large language model (LLM) evaluation, deployment optimization, and cost-efficient strategies for training and deploying ML systems.

## What You'll Find Here

This blog is where I share my thoughts on:

- **Technology & Engineering**: Deep dives into distributed systems, ML infrastructure, and cloud-native technologies
- **Industry Insights**: Observations from the trenches of building AI/ML platforms at scale  
- **Personal Reflections**: Musings on leadership, career growth, and the occasional non-tech topic
- **Open Source**: Projects I'm working on and contributions to the community

When I'm not buried in code or architecture diagrams, you might find me exploring new hiking trails, experimenting with photography, or getting lost in a good book.
