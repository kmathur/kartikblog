## Blog in the age of AI 

In the age of AI, where machines can generate text, images, and even code, blogging might seem almost redundant. Yet, I write because blogging allows me to capture my thoughts, reflect deeply, and share a uniquely human perspective that no AI can replicate. It’s a space to explore ideas, document learning, and connect with readers in a personal way—reminding me that even in a world of automation, human curiosity and creativity remain invaluable.
