# Couples Therapy between EMs and PMs

No matter what your org chart says, if you’re building a lasting product, you’re in a product and tech relationship. Make it a good one.

Good means effective and efficient, but also enjoyable. That kind of partnership takes time, care, and intention.

Here are the three pillars of a strong product and tech relationship:

- **Alignment** — Are you actually on the same page? Leadership styles, ways of working, and long-term goals need to match before you can make real progress.
- **Date Night** — Keep the spark alive with regular check-ins, syncs, and collaborative rituals to ensure ongoing alignment — especially at the leadership level.
- **Best Friend to Moan To** — No relationship is without its challenges. Have a trusted partner to vent, troubleshoot, and work through friction before it turns into conflict.

**Key takeaways**

- A laugh or two as I share stories from the messy reality at the intersection between product and tech and what we can learn from them
- Tools and best practices for alignment and collaboration
