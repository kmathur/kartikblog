*The drudgery of my commute*

---

In the sea of faceless gleaming cars,<br>
each one messy, broken in its own way—<br>
sparkling headlights glimmer from afar,<br>
peer inside and it is all dark.

Every morning, without a choice,<br>
driven to work by someone it did not choose,<br>
checked and cleaned on schedule<br>
while mounting miles and silent faults eat it away.

Each day inching closer to collapse,<br>
at a push of pedal, racing so fast—<br>
it has no life, they say,<br>
and yet its everyday life is all of us.

Same house, same routine, same every day,<br>
without a choice.<br>
Some have alloy wheels and some have designer lights,<br>
meticulously designed to look apart,<br>
spent a huge sum to hide the drudgery.

When rubber hits the road,<br>
no one pauses to admire—<br>
the sameness is not for outside<br>
but in its fate.

One missed step<br>
and it's all over.

## Reflection Notes

This poem emerged from countless mornings spent in Bay Area traffic, watching the endless stream of vehicles on Highway 101. What struck me was the parallel between cars and their drivers—both trapped in routines neither chose, both wearing down with each passing day.

The imagery shifts between the mechanical (cars) and the human (us), blurring the line between machine and operator. We customize our vehicles with fancy wheels and lights, trying to assert individuality within conformity, but underneath we're all subject to the same fate—the daily grind that slowly wears us down.

The "sea of faceless gleaming cars" represents modern life itself: beautiful on the surface, dark within, racing toward an inevitable breakdown. The poem questions whether we control our machines or they control us, and whether our attempts to stand out matter when we're all traveling the same road.

The final line—"One missed step and it's all over"—speaks to the fragility hiding beneath our routine. Whether it's a mechanical failure or a moment's inattention, the illusion of control can shatter instantly.
