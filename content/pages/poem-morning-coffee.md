# The Morning Coffee Ritual

*A meditation on daily routines and finding mindfulness in simple moments*

---

**Steam rises like prayers**  
from ceramic altars,  
each cup a communion  
with the waking world.

**The grinder's song**  
breaks the morning silence—  
beans surrendering their essence  
to become something greater.

**First sip: awareness**  
flooding tired synapses,  
consciousness blooming  
like coffee flowers in highland sun.

**This ritual, repeated**  
ten thousand mornings,  
yet each dawn discovers  
new depth in familiar warmth.

**Between sleep and action**  
lies this sacred pause—  
where intention meets caffeine  
and the day begins to breathe.

## Reflection Notes

This poem emerged from my morning meditation practice, where I noticed how the simple act of making coffee had become a form of mindfulness. The ritual creates a bridge between the unconscious state of sleep and the conscious engagement with the day ahead.

The imagery draws from the coffee's journey—from bean to cup to consciousness—as a metaphor for transformation and awakening.
