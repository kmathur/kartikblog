In the age of AI generated content, I’m going a bit old school and using this space to write and share my own thoughts. I’ll write about things that interest me in general, along with technical topics around AI and large scale infrastructure.

I’ve been writing informally for quite some time, mostly for myself, and I’m now starting to compile and share some of those recent thoughts here. This is very much an experiment, a place to think out loud, explore ideas, and see where they lead. Ideally, I would love for this to grow into a small community where I can share ideas, learn from others, and have thoughtful conversations along the way
